            person's body mass index based on their weight and height. BMI is a
            simple measure used to determine whether a person is at a healthy

            <h2>Usefulness of BMI Calculator</h2>
            <p>
              BMI calculator is a tool that makes it easy to calculate one's
              Body Mass Index. By inputting weight and height data, this
              calculator automatically calculates BMI and assigns corresponding
              categories based on the results, such as underweight, normal
              weight, overweight, or obese. The BMI calculator is useful in
              monitoring an individual's weight status and helps in making
              health and lifestyle related decisions, such as whether to lose or
              gain weight to achieve optimal health status. It is also useful in
              a medical or fitness setting to conduct a quick screening for
              weight-related health risks.

                <li>Underweight (BMI < 18.5)</li>
                <p>
                  Underweight is a condition where a person's BMI is below 18.5,
                  which can increase the risk of malnutrition, anemia, and
                  osteoporosis. To overcome underweight, it is recommended to
                  increase calorie intake with nutrient-rich foods such as
                  protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.
                </p>
                <li>Healthy Weight (BMI 18.5 - 24.9)</li>
                <p>
                  Healthy weight is the ideal condition with a BMI between 18.5
                  and 24.9. In this category, the risk of chronic diseases is
                  relatively low. To maintain a healthy weight, it is important
                  to maintain a balanced diet and exercise regularly.
                </p>
                <li>Overweight (BMI 25 - 29.9)</li>
                <p>
                  Overweight is a condition where a person's BMI is between 25
                  and 29.9. Overweight people are at a higher risk of heart
                  disease, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Overcoming
                  overweight can be done by reducing calorie intake, eating
                  healthy foods, and exercising regularly.
                </p>
                <li>Obesity (BMI ≥ 30)</li>
                <p>
                  Obese is a condition when the BMI is above 30, which increases
                  the serious risk of various diseases such as heart disease,
                  diabetes, and some types of cancer. Treating obesity usually
                  involves significant lifestyle changes, including a strict
                  diet, intensive physical activity, and in some cases, medical
                  interventions such as bariatric surgery. Prevention and
                  treatment of obesity requires a sustained approach with
                  support from healthcare professionals to ensure long-term
                  success.
